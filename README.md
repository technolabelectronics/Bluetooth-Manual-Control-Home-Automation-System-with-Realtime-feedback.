 #Introduction
In this article I am going to make a very useful and very easy home-automation system.
In this home-automation system we will control our home-appliances from the android app through Bluetooth and we can also control the appliances via manual switch buttons that we regularly do, Now You’re thinking we already make this project!  yes you are  right!
But in this home-automation project we have updated something, Now we can get the real time feedback in the app.
Here I am  using the inbuilt Bluetooth connectivity of esp32. So internet, WIFI is not required in this home-automation system. 
And also we don’t required any IOT or cloud platform.

Most of people don’t have internet or WIFI Connectivity, So this home-automation project is perfect for them.
The only downside of this project is , here we are using the Bluetooth, So in this project we can only control our appliances in local area networks…not globally. apart from this everything is great in this project.

This app is absolutely free and you can download it from the play-store.
